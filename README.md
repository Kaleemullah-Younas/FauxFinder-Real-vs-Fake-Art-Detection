# FauxFinder-Real-vs-Fake-Art-Detection
This project uses a DCGAN to generate fake art images and a CNN model to classify images as real or fake. The dataset consists of real art images and AI-generated art, and the model is trained to distinguish between them with 85% accuracy. The project leverages PyTorch and a GPU for efficient training.
