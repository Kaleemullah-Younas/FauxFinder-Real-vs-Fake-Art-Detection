## 🚀 Introduction & Objective

The **FauxFinder** project aims to distinguish between **real art** and **AI-generated art** using deep learning models. With the rise of AI-generated art, this tool provides a reliable way to identify whether an artwork is created by a human or an AI. The app allows users to upload images and receive predictions with confidence scores, helping them understand the nature of the artwork.

The primary objective is to provide an **easy-to-use interface** for classifying art while maintaining high accuracy and interpretability. The app also allows users to select from multiple models for classification.

## 🎯 Features

- **Real vs Fake Art Classification**: Predicts whether an image is real art or AI-generated.
- **Model Selection**: Choose between three models:
  - **Custom CNN (85% Accuracy)**
  - **MobileNetV1 (95% Accuracy)**
  - **MobileNetV2 (92% Accuracy)**
- **Confidence Scores**: Displays the model's confidence level for each prediction.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface with dynamic background, progress bars, and clear visual feedback.
